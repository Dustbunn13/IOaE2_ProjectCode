        <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
        <p>The concept of a gumball machine has always been one of wonder, growing up, it's a fun cheap way for kids to get some candy for themselves by exchanging change for sweets. I wanted to bring that sense of whimsy into this project, but elevate it further through using connected objects to sense and react to its surroundings.</p>
        
        <p>Combining a Servo 180ยบ motor and the Feather, I wanted to simulate the experience of the machine by having it operate like a gumboil machine to deposit snacks or candy into something, in this case let's say a bowl. When the bowl is present, a signal is sent to the feather to start the Servo Motor which will then rotate, opening the hatch and letting a snack or candy fall into the bowl, then stop after one turn. The appearance of the bowl to hold food is meant to connect hunger between people and the objects in the environment.</p>

            <p>Starting with the first version of the machine, I sketched out a box on stilts which serve to keep it propped up as well as be open enough to put something underneath it. When something is propped underneath the object (such as a bowl) the food gets dispensed.</p> 
            <p>For a version 2 I wanted to explore using a weight sensor to detect the weight of the bowl when it comes into contact with where the sensor is stored. Creating a thin but sturdy platform to house the objects, when the weight of the bowl is detected it sends a signal to the Feather to dispense food. Due to some limitations of supplies this wasn't explored in the physical prototype for Project 1.</p>

            <p>When data is received, the Servo Motor will do one rotation of the wooden plate placed where the hole of the box is, temporarily letting food out. On the box, the motor will be located on another side by the edge so that when it rotates the wooden plate moves on the same plane as it's placed on.</p>

        <h3>The User Experience</h3>
        <p>For Project 1, when the user interacts with the computer to put an input into the system (pressing a button on a webpage in this case), it sends data to the Feather that gets the Servo Motor to respond by doing an action. This data is received and stored on Adafruit.io as well.</p>
        
        <p>When initially planning this project, I had aimed to use a sensor (ideally a weight sensor) to detect weight on a certain area, send that data through the feather to Adafruit.io and Firebird, and if the conditions are met, sends data back through to the Feather and that activates the Servo Motor as a response. This concept will be explored further at a later point due to the subtle nature that comes with the user interaction. For now, it requires the user to press something to get the connected object to perform it's intended function.</p>

        <p>In terms of the overall user experience, the goal of the object is to connect hunger with giving food, using the bowl or some form of thing that can hold food as a sign that the user is hungry and would like a refill of food into said object. Using the Table Exercise from Week 1, here's the thought process behind the interaction.</p>
